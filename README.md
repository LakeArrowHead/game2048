# game2048
my code for CS61B project game2048

A high level overview of this project can be found at https://youtu.be/Xzihuj_JZBI.
You’ve probably seen and perhaps played the game “2048,” a single-player computer game written by Gabriele Cirulli, 
and based on an earlier game “1024” by Veewo Studio (see his on-line version of 2048).

In this project, I help built the core logic of this game. 
Specifically, I filled out 4 methods in the Model.java file which governs what happens after certain key-presses from the user.
